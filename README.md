# NestJS Hexagonal Architecture

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to **integrate online payments** in a **NestJS application** using the **Factory Pattern**, structured within a robust **Hexagonal Architecture**.

It serves as a hands-on guide to building a modular and scalable payment system that supports multiple payment gateways (e.g., **eSewa**, **Khalti**). The project is being documented through a detailed multi-part blog series to help developers adopt best practices and clean architecture in real-world NestJS applications.

Whether you're new to Hexagonal Architecture or looking to streamline payment integrations, this repository will provide a solid foundation to build on.

## Installation
```sh
npm install
```

## Running the Application
